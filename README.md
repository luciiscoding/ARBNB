Welcome to Horesca Traveling, an immersive concept app designed for curious and passionate travelers who love doing their own research. 

🌍 Project Overview

As a vivid traveler, you want more than just pictures and descriptions. Horesca Traveling combines:

Detailed Mobile Stats: View comprehensive data about each accommodation — pricing, location trends, ratings and more.

MR Headset Experience: Explore accommodations remotely with MR support — get a spatial sense of the room, locate key appliances and receive interactive AR instructions on-site.


 Features

🔍 Mobile UI for accommodation research

📊 Data-driven insights: Compare multiple listings efficiently

🏡 AR/MR integration concepts for in-room interaction and walkthrough

🗺️ User-first flow: Curated for researchers and planners who like control over every trip detail

⚠️ Disclaimer

Figma itself does not support full VR simulation (like head tracking or stereoscopic 3D), so the features of viewing a 360° accommodation in VR has been momentarily replaced with a static picture in this prototype.
